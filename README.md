Fostex D80 filesystem reader lib and windows tool to export (sience 2006)

This code was developed on Sourceforge from 2006 to 2008. Just moved here to github now.

The project was made in order to eliminate the problem of different file system used in Fostex D-80 Hard disk recorder units. The file system is very simply, but linux (and rest of the) operation systems are unable to open it. First of all this project is on (heavy) development phase.Actually the audio data format is known, and tempo map format also known, but there are a lot of things what still unknown. 
The first goal of this project really is NOT to provide a useful tool-set for Audio Engineers, but to provide a tool-set to further software development processes. So, the status is really early, because this step is one of the steps in reverse engineering phase. 
Any (a lot of) helps are welcomed! :)
